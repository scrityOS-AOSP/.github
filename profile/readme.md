ScrityOS AOSP
---------------

> Welcome to ScrityOS AOSP!

> ScrityOS is based on FortuneOS, a project by @Kizziama (also their Telegram handle). I have deep respect for this project and am using its AOSP foundation in a community-driven way. This ROM will be focused exclusively on Android 15, serving as a platform for learning and exploring Android development. You could say this is a Kang, but it’s not—credits are right up there. Think of it as "community borrowing with permission!"
